### Hey! I'm Ahmed! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer with over six years of programming experience and more than two years of professional experience in the software industry. I started programming at the age of 12 and I have been fascinated by the idea of transforming my ideas into reality through code ever since. I have extensive experience building joyful yet performant front- ends using JavaScript, React, and React Native. I also participate in open source and I maintain some React Native packages to give back to the community. I am a fast learner and I enjoy challenges because I believe that challenges teach us the most important lessons. I have a strong curiosity for how things work and I like to explore the internals of the technologies I use. I also have a deep interest in the theoretical aspects of computer science and the mathematics behind it.
